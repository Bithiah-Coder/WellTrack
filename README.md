  # WellTrack – Fitness & Wellness Tracker

WellTrack is a simple one‑user fitness and wellness tracker built as a website. There are **no sign‑ups, no logins, and no accounts**. The user enters their name once, and all data is stored locally in their own browser. Nothing is sent to servers or shared with third parties.

The site lets the user track daily workouts, calories, water intake, sleep, and meals. Our layout and visuals are designed in Figma, and we are building the actual site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project is hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access and testing.
